don't be afraid when your mom says
something wrong and you've to stand
up to her. it'll lead to a major argument.
it'll be a hard battle, but just know that
their idea of living a life is different from
yours. just know, they come from a 
different generation.

you have seen your elder sister cry into the
pillow after the breakup. you'd seen your
parents fight over dinner about little things.
you've watched your best friend lose too
much of weight after her breakup, but don't
be afraid of loving someone just because it
didn't work out for everyone else.

growing up, you're going to lose people.
you're going to realise that the ones who
are closest to you do will feel like a
stranger a few years later, and it is okay.
just don't be afraid of losing people
