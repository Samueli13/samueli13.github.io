I wonder
How the thought of being loved feels like,
To cherish the ecstasies it could offer.

I wonder
How it feels like,
To make someone's day alright by just existing.

I wonder
How it feels like,
To be lost in someone's world of thoughts.

I wonder
How it feels like,
To be admired for even the little imperfections.

I wonder
How it feels like,
To be more than just enough.

I wonder
For a virgin soul like me.

If I would ever be loved...each day and all the way...
to sense that love is the missing piece and
it is all I ever need..
