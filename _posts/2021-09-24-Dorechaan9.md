## Ishq-3

If I were to write about celestial bodies,
I would think about the infinite chances life could extend.

If I were to write about hardships
I would think about the people who will help me through it 

If I were to write about pain,
I would think about the loss that caused it.

If I were to write about love,
I would think about how much one could sacrifice. 

If I were to write about failure,
I would think about the lesson it might teach me.

If I were to write about success,
I would think about the fulfillment in my parents eyes.

But.....

If I were to write about you,
I would think about how complete you make me feel in every way.
