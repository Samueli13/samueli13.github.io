## Maut-2

And all this while, I wondered.
"was I not good enough"?
Turns out I'd assumed she 
likes me back, just because
I liked her.

In a few months, things started 
to get normal. We went back
to being best friends,
We even started going out with other people.

Looking back, I'm glad we
didn't date each other.
We would've made a
terrible couple.
our feelings often blind us.
She saw it, I didn't. Not at first.

That was it.
I was friendzoned.
And honestly,
It wasn't a bad place to be in.
