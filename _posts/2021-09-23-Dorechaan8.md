To love
Knowing that this won't last,
Takes a lot of courage.

To love
Knowing that you can't see her the same way,
Takes a lot of patience.

To love
Knowing that you won't be waking up next to her,
May drive you insane.

To love
Knowing that you won't be able to hold her hands,
Takes you to a new level of pain.

To love
Knowing that one day you have to let this go Kills you inside.

To love
Knowing that you can't even share this to 
single soul, Hurts a lot.

To love
Only hoping that this dream you are in lasts forever.

To have this heavenly feeling of being with her,
Only craving her presence.

Takes a lot to be you.
