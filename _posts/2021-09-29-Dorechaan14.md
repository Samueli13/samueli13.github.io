## Ibadat-2
The agony is real 
Trying to simmer it down
I put myself aloof.

Always wondering when this will be over
Like a play behind the curtains
No one to entertain.

The feelings are too deep
Now I only wish for that pit
To be burried.

The ending is clear
But the path is lonelier
With heavy steps I walk
To make the journey better and better.
