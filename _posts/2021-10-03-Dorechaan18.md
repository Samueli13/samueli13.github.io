## Junoon-2

you're still friends with people who think 
differently than you do, with whom you 
don't talk to every day, and with whom you 
can't connect anymore. It's okay to let go.
you don't have to be friends with them
just because you were friends once.

one day, you'll realise that you're no
longer in love with your high school
girlfriend. You realise,
you two have little in common anymore. The spark has disappeared,
the conversations feel forced. Nothing went wrong,
you two grew up and you two grew apart.

you will meet someone on the internet,
and it'll be perfect, but they'd be some 
thousand miles away. don't hold 
yourself back from getting to know
them, okay? remember, you are only
a flight away from them.
