## Ibadat-3
The early mornings and the beautiful sunsets 
could never match the warmth
of your cuddles.

If you come by any day it makes me
feel alright than a self care day
You are the missing piece to my messy
unsolved puzzle.

With teary eyes, I could tell that
you are the one I want to dance with
in a heavy rain.

Your precious personality makes me 
proud of myself reminding me that
I am a masterpiece.

This world might be a darker place
but with you around,
I feel a bit safe.


Inspired from the album "Pieces of Love" by the one and only @twicetagram.
