## Ibadat-1
The old piano sat in despair 
Mourning the death of her beloved
Unhinged that she won't be stroked again.

The flowers in the garden
Suffered in silence
Devoured by the absence of their beautiful caretaker.

The dog had a weary look
Sulking in the corner
Expecting the return of a carefree smile.

The sky looked pale
Not knowing what to say
Learning to give up its yearning hopes.
