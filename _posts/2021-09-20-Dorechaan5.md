## Uns-2


On one of those long lonely nights
I vouch for your presence
When music isn't of much help
I yelp for your touch to wrap me up
humbly.

And your chocolate brown eyes doing the charm.
The sight of your sweet little laugh 
tickling my heart.

Oh! To live with you every day
Isn't it a dream?
Eventually when this fantasy casts away
I come to my senses burying the void
within,knowing that I might be guilty 
as charged in court of love.
But this little facade will never fade out.
