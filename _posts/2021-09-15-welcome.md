## About Me

I am your friendly, neighborhood Samuel Mamidi. A Chemical Engineering Student from Visakhapatnam.
I am an above average, mean teenager who is totally into Marvel & Dc movies, my favorite Marvel superhero is The Spiderman
I follow his soul words which inspired me i.e., WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY 

Alike others, my habits are Sleeping in the daytime and be a Night Owl surfing Instagram, watching life hacks, and worrying about my future LOL. My goal in life is simple I want to become an Animation Movie Director, directing feel-good movies adaptable by kids. I spend daily 1hour of time in my rest room bring out Mr.Creative in me & imagining I being a Superhero saving earth from my Maths Teacher.

One day while I was thinking... how to save the earth from Matharine (Maths teacher) in my rest in the morning though I was getting late for college and all of sudden an idea struck me of Making an Animated movie compressing the Famous cartoon characters SHINCHAN & DOREAMON. This may sound very kiddish and funny but you don't how interesting it would be unless you go and read my next blog.

What happens when two completely different universes strike each other. What happens when Mr.Naughty meets Mrs.Compassion!

What happens when SHINCHAN meets DORAEMON?

Have to wait for My next Blog to Get the Answers to the above-raised Questions.
