## Maut-1

She and I often 
went out together.
We'd stay up late,
talking about everything
and nothing.

We were best friends
and I really liked her. I suppose
she liked me back, too.
So one day, I decided
to tell her.

She said she likes me
"as a friend". It crushed me.
But I don't blame her.
because she never hinted
or led me on in any way.

So we decided to stay friends,
but, our friendship was now
awkward. We made small talks and avoided 
each other often.
