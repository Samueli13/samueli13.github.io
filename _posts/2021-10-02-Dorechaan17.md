## Junoon-1

We might not be the best team
But we are a part of each other's dreams.

As shady it might seem to you
It's got nothing to do with you.

A ship might sink sometimes
But we don't dare to let the person drown.

The complications are the beauty
Just like the Japanese kintsugi.


We dive in together
to be with each other
to the eternity.
