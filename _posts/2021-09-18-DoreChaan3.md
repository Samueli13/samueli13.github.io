## Dilkashi-3

Shinchan wakeup so early even before the alarm rings, quickly gets off the bed, and goes to the washroom. Alike others Shinchan spends a lot of time in the washroom imagining as he a superhero saving the earth from her evil Villain DAGER-DEVIL, but this time it was different. He was imagining going to school with Doraemon and blushing... Shinchan skipped his breakfast and left the house. Shinchan's mom was really shocked as he woke up early without her mom waking up, completed his daily chores quickly, and already left home skipping his breakfast. Shinchan reached Doraemon's house and was waiting eagerly.
