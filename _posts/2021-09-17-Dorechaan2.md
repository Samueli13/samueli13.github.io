Doraemon was feeling very nervous and shy as everything around was completely new, she was just smiling at Yoshinaga and sat on the chair. After some time all the girls in the class came to her and introduced themselves, she felt comfortable and felt better. Few boys came to her and showing off which she didn't care about and neglected them, on the other hand, Shinchan was just staring at her but not taking any step to go and introduce himself. Time passed and it was evening, time to go home.

Doraemon had already made few friends in which Mii-chan was near her house and they both started going home. Shinchan was just following her to know her house, he was maintaining a safe distance so that Doraemon and Mii-chan wouldn't know that they were been followed by Shinchan.
