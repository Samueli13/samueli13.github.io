## Ishq-1

This brain of ours 

Plays its petty games To put our guts out.

This brain of ours

Keeps us at stake To bring out the best in us.

This brain of ours

Gives us thoughts To be more compassionate.

This brain of ours 

Knows no one to blame Except the giddy heart.

But so does this brain of ours,

Makes us go through pain To never repeat a mistake twice again.
