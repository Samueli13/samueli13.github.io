## Ibadat-2
One taught me to cuss
And another saved me from a mess.

One let me borrow her notes
The other made me write his.

One gaurded the door while talking to my crush
The other made me find a brother to bond.

One took me out to eat
The other emptied my meal.

One taught the need to be selfish
But the other showed how wonderful it 
Is to be selfless.

One caressed around by being a child
The other held to say that you have to be uptight.

One proved how to be there for others
The other showed you can stay strong
By yourselves.

One listened to my talks
Vividly The other made sure to make me
Comfortable unknowingly.

One set higher goals to love 
The other found another way to live.

One stood determined
The other decided to slay the world 
and not mind anyone.

Learnt alot from each one of you guys
to go through anything in life 
Not to be so cringe
But you are my real life version of F.R.I.E.N.D.S and many more.
